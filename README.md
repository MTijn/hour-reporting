# Hour reporting

Making it easier to report your worked ours into Tempo.

## What it does
It will take the hours you logged into tempo, request all the meetings you had
in the previous month, and create Tempo log entries for the hours you weren't working on
a ticket or story.

It will create meetings till your working hours of the period are matched.
